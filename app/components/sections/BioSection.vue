        Hi, I'm Samuel. I work as a Product Architect, which is just a formal way of saying I design
        complex digital ecosystems and code them from scratch. I build architectures that are solid
        like concrete, but move like water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obsessed with micro-interactions, clean code, and injecting a bit of controlled chaos into
        the web.
